This repo integrates OVERT with reachability functionality for the purpose of verifying closed-loop systems with neural network control policies.
[OVERT](https://github.com/sisl/OVERT.jl) is a `julia` package that provides a relational piecewise-linear overapproximation of any multi-dimensional function. 
Such an overapproximation is used for converting smooth nonlinear functions that commonly appear in closed-loop dynamical systems into a set of relations with piecewise-linear functions such as `min` and `max`. 
The overapproximated dynamics, together with the neural network control policy (which is assumed to be ReLU-activated) is then represented as a mixed integer program using an encoding inspired by the [MIPVerify algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07356).
This system is unrolled in time and used to answer bounded-time reachability queries such as: can the closed loop system avoid an unsafe set? Or reach a goal set?

## Dependencies
By default, this package will use GLPK as it is open-source. However, Gurobi tends to perform better and was used for the experiments in the paper. If you have or can obtain a Gurobi license, it is recommended to use Gurobi. An academic Gurobi license can be acquired for free here:

The Julia dependencies are listed in the Project.toml file and will be automatically installed when you add the package (see Installation below).
